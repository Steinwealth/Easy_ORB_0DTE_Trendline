Prime Stealth Trailing Stop & Take Profit System
===============================================

SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all position management, stop/TP updates, and exit decisions.
This module is the ONLY component that writes to stops/TP and triggers position closures.

Production-Hardened Features (Chat A+ Review):
- Execution adapter pattern (Demo/Live separation)
- Hysteresis & cooldowns (prevents churn)
- ATR/Spread floor guards (realistic stop distances)
- Gap-risk detection (session boundary protection)
- Partial profit ladder (scale-outs at +3%/+7%)
- Mode-bound trailing profiles (explosive/moon tightening)
- Side-aware math (LONG/SHORT future-proof)
- Concurrency locks (thread-safe)
- Snapshot/restore (persistence on restart)
- Single-brain contract (managers read-only)

Key Features:
- Stealth trailing stops that adapt to market conditions
- Breakeven protection at +0.5% as requested
- Dynamic take profit targets based on volatility
- Hidden stop management (not visible to market)
- Multi-timeframe trailing logic
- Volume-based trailing adjustments
- Momentum-based trailing activation
- Risk-reward optimization
- Integration with existing Prime Trading Manager
